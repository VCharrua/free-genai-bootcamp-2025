## Business Goal 

A language learning school wants to build a prototype of learning portal which will act as three things:
- Inventory of possible vocabulary that can be learned
- Act as a  Learning record store (LRS), providing correct and wrong score on practice vocabulary
- A unified launchpad to launch different learning apps
