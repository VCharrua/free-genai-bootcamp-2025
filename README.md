## Project Overview <!-- ‚ú® -->

This AI Language Assistant aims to extend the language offering and also augment the learning experience for students between instructor-led classes in a fictitious school website for the purpose of participating in the ExamPro GenAI Bootcamp 2025.

This project has the following main objectives:
- Build a collection of learning apps using various different use-cases of AI
- Maintain the learning experience the learning portal using AI developer tools
- Extend the platform to support various different languages

<br />
After the conclusion of this bootcamp, the results and concepts materialized during the implementation of this project will be applied in a real solution to support the teaching and learning of national languages for the educational system in Angola.


### Main Features
