Considerations and next steps::

- The first sentence is a question about a past event - consider how questions are formed in Portuguese
- For "this morning," think about how time expressions are typically placed in Portuguese sentences
- The second sentence uses the past continuous tense - consider how ongoing actions in the past are expressed
- For "looking at," consider how the verb "olhar" combines with prepositions
- Think about how possessives work when referring to "our garden"
- Remember that Portuguese has different forms of "you" - consider which would be appropriate in this context

You can:

- Try forming the question part first
- Ask about past tense conjugation
- Ask about time expression placement
- Ask about how to form the continuous past tense
- Ask about possessive pronouns
- Make an attempt at either sentence
