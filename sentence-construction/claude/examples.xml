            - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the the vocabulary table.
            - BAD: Insuficient number of glues given to the student.
            - BAD: The sentence structure is missing or is insufficient, we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Subject] [Verb] [Prepositional Phrase] [Interrogative Clause]
            - BAD: Missing possible next steps

            Great! Let's break down the sentence step by step.

            ### Clue 1: 
            The subject of the first part is "Bears." You need to find the Portuguese word for "bear" in the plural form.

            Try to think through these clues, and feel free to ask if you need more help! I'll also give you the vocabulary table to guide you:

            | Portuguese  | English     |
            |-------------|-------------|
            | Urso        | Bear        |
            | São         | Are         |
            | Porta       | Door        |
            | Lixo        | Garbage     |
            | Deixar      | To leave    |
            | Fora        | Out         |

            - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence structure
            - GOOD: Suficient number of glues.
            - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations

            Great! Let's break down the sentence step by step.

            ### Clue 1: 
            The subject of the first part is "Bears." You need to find the Portuguese word for "bear" in the plural form.

            ### Clue 2:
            The verb "are" is a form of "to be." The correct form in Portuguese is related to the subject (plural). What would that be?

            ### Clue 3: 
            "At the door" is indicating location. Think of the Portuguese word for "door" and how to express "at" in this context.

            Try to think through these clues, and feel free to ask if you need more help! I'll also give you the vocabulary table to guide you:

            | Portuguese  | English     |
            |-------------|-------------|
            | Urso        | Bear        |
            | São         | Are         |
            | Porta       | Door        |
            | Lixo        | Garbage     |
            | Deixar      | To leave    |
            | Fora        | Out         |

            ### Possible sentence structure:
            [Subject] + [verb] + [location], [verb] + [object] + [question]? 

            ### Considerations:
            - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma.
            - The first part is stating the location where something exists.
            - The second part is asking about a past action.

            ### Possible next steps
            - attempt an answer
            - ask clues about location marking
            - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
            - ask clues about question formulation
            - ask clues about verb conjugation
